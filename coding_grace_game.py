CodingGrace: Text-Based Adventure Game
=======================================
A text-based adventure game with three rooms, a Rock-Paper-Scissors
mini-game, ASCII art, and a player-state dictionary that tracks the
player's name, health, inventory, and choices throughout the game.

Game structure
--------------
    - Three rooms: Red (Painful Truth), Blue (Blissful Ignorance),
      Green (Magic / Rock-Paper-Scissors).
    - A guard encounter in the Blue Room that requires the correct
      sequence of actions to escape.
    - A global player_info dictionary, passed explicitly to every
      function, that holds the player's state.

Key programming concepts illustrated
-------------------------------------
    - Dictionaries for structured data
    - Functions with parameters and return values
    - While-loops for repeated interaction
    - Custom exception classes for control flow
    - Input validation and string matching
    - Floating-point comparison with math.isclose()
    - f-strings for formatted output
"""

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IMPORTS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `random` provides functions for generating pseudo-random numbers.
# We use random.choices() in the Rock, Paper, Scissors mini-game to let
# the computer pick its move according to weighted probabilities.
import random

# `math` provides mathematical functions and constants.
# We use math.isclose() to safely compare floating-point sums (see rps()).
import math


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CUSTOM EXCEPTION FOR GAME-ENDING EVENTS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# When the player dies or wins, the game needs to stop immediately — even if
# execution is deep inside nested function calls.  A custom exception is
# well suited for this purpose because raising it unwinds the entire call
# stack back to wherever it is caught.
#
# This approach is preferable to calling exit() because exit() terminates
# the entire Python process.  In environments like Jupyter or Google Colab,
# that produces an unwanted SystemExit traceback instead of a clean ending.
#
# KEY CONCEPT: Exception classes inherit from Python's built-in Exception.
# You can attach any data you want — here we store a message string.

class GameOver(Exception):
    """Raised when the game ends, whether by death or victory."""
    pass


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# INITIALIZE PLAYER STATE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# We store all player information in a single dictionary.  This makes it
# easy to pass the entire game state to any function that needs it.
#
# KEY CONCEPT: A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs.
# Here the keys are strings ("name", "level", etc.) and the values are
# different types — a string, integers, and lists.

player_info = {
    "name": "",           # Will be set by get_player_name()
    "level": 1,           # Tracks how far the player has progressed
    "inventory": [],      # Items the player has collected
    "location": "Starting Room",
    "health": 100,        # Hit points; reduced by damage, restored by healing
    "choices": []         # History of rooms the player has visited
}


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# HELPER: DISPLAY PLAYER INFO
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Rather than repeating the same for-loop every time we want to show the
# player's status, we put it in its own function.  This is the DRY
# principle: "Don't Repeat Yourself."

    Returns:
        A tuple of three strings: (label, user_choice, result)
        where result is one of: "win", "lose", "tie", "exit", "invalid"

    DESIGN NOTE — floating-point comparison:
        When user_wins is a list, we need to verify that its elements sum
        to 1.0.  However, floating-point arithmetic is imprecise:
            >>> 0.1 + 0.2 + 0.7
            0.9999999999999999
        That is *not* equal to 1.0, so a simple == check would wrongly
        reject valid weights.  math.isclose() allows a small tolerance and
        handles these rounding differences correctly.

    DESIGN NOTE — structured return values:
        The third element of the returned tuple is always one of the fixed
        strings "win", "lose", "tie", "exit", or "invalid".  Callers can
        compare against these constants directly (e.g., result == "win")
        rather than searching inside display-oriented phrases, which would
        be fragile and error-prone.
